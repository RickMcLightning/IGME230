## Mechanics
### Modifiers
Different abilities and items modify various stats in the game,
such as reducing incoming damage for 30 seconds or increasing movement
speed for 15 seconds. Others are less powerful passive buffs that
permanently grant small stat bonuses or unique abilities.
### Dodge
The character will have a dodge roll ability that allows them to avoid 
damage for a brief window of time.
### Elemental Damage
Certain enemies have elemental types that indicate they take reduced damage
from attacks of the same element and bonus damage from one other. Normal damage
is unaffected by these elemental resistances to prevent the player from being
totally incapable of harming the enemies.
### Level System
During the game, killing enemies grants experience, and given enough experience
they player levels up. Each level grants a stat increase and a skill point. Each
skill point can be spent in one of the three skill trees.
### Skill Trees
Skill points can be spent here, and there are three trees. The first focuses on 
shooting enemies with the player's bow, the second focuses on quick dodges and melee
strikes, and the third focuses on magic attacks, self buffing, and area of effect 
enemy debuffs.

## Onboarding
Basic controls for movement, attacking, and menus are on the floor of the starting room,
like The Binding of Isaac, and the HUD elements for more advanced mechanics such as spells
have labels on them for what button triggers them. 
## Player Learning
The player needs to learn elemental matchups such as fire < water, how to efficiently use spells, 
such as finding the right moments to drop the smokescreen ability to slow enemy movement and protect
against projectiles. They need to learn how skills interact with each other, such as stacking magic effects.
