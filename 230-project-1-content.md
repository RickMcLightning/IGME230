# Story
Simply put the player is a Doctor being put through a training zone known in the Order as "The Pit"
that is supposed to hone an individual's combat effectiveness in a worst case scenario. Members compete
for the highest score as determined by time survived and enemies defeated. Though the enemies are branded
as mindless zombies, some of them aren't as mindless as first thought.
## Theme
Uncertainty. Mindless zombies isn't neccesarily true for certain enemies.
## Mood
Excitement. The action should be intense, especially in the later stages.
## Premise
There are hostiles, and you kill them. 
## Player Motivation
The player is trying to get the highest score they can. They can choose to disregard the idea of
"mindless zombies" or not.
# Aesthetics
## Graphics
16 bit pixel art
## Sound
16 bit music

There'll be sound for attacking, using abilities, defeating an enemy, taking
damage, and clicking on menu items. Music will be split between menus, and stage music
currently with one track each.
# Gameplay
## Mechanics
### Modifiers
Different abilities and items modify various stats in the game,
such as reducing incoming damage for 30 seconds or increasing movement
speed for 15 seconds. Others are less powerful passive buffs that
permanently grant small stat bonuses or unique abilities.
### Dodge
The character will have a dodge roll ability that allows them to avoid 
damage for a brief window of time.
### Elemental Damage
Certain enemies have elemental types that indicate they take reduced damage
from attacks of the same element and bonus damage from one other. Normal damage
is unaffected by these elemental resistances to prevent the player from being
totally incapable of harming the enemies.
### Level System
During the game, killing enemies grants experience, and given enough experience
they player levels up. Each level grants a stat increase and a skill point. Each
skill point can be spent in one of the three skill trees.
### Skill Trees
Skill points can be spent here, and there are three trees. The first focuses on 
shooting enemies with the player's bow, the second focuses on quick dodges and melee
strikes, and the third focuses on magic attacks, self buffing, and area of effect 
enemy debuffs.

## Onboarding
Basic controls for movement, attacking, and menus are on the floor of the starting room,
like The Binding of Isaac, and the HUD elements for more advanced mechanics such as spells
have labels on them for what button triggers them. 
## Player Learning
The player needs to learn elemental matchups such as water beating fire, how to efficiently use spells, 
such as finding the right moments to drop the smokescreen ability to slow enemy movement and protect
against projectiles. They need to learn how skills interact with each other, such as stacking magic effects.
